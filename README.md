<p>Machine learning – and in particular, deep learning – is rapidly opening new horizons for research in the humanities and social sciences. However, scholars in the humanities and social sciences can encounter barriers to learning about such techniques – for example, machine learning courses, especially at the graduate level, often require multivariate calculus, linear algebra and prior coding experience, which students in the humanities and less quantitative social sciences may lack. This course offers a practical introduction to deep learning for graduate students, without assuming knowledge of calculus or other college-level math, or any prior experience with coding. By the end of the course, students will: </p>

<ul><li>be able to code and train a variety of basic deep learning models</li>
<li>develop an appreciation of the range of humanities/social science research questions to which deep learning can be applied</li>
<li>be fluent collaborators on research projects that involve machine learning experts</li>
<li>gain an understanding than will inform theorizing about machine learning (e.g., for research in AI ethics, technology policy, etc)</li></ul>

<p>Interested Princeton graduate students from any department should <a href="mailto:sjleslie@princeton.edu">email me</a> with any questions they may have. Princeton post-docs and other researchers are welcome to audit (providing that space permits).</p>
